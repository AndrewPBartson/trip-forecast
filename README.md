# Trip Forecast

**Trip Forecast** is a web application that provides seven-day weather forecasts for multiple locations. The user selects the locations by clicking on the map. For example, the user may select locations along the route of a proposed trip. When the user clicks the "Show Forecasts" button, the map disappears and is replaced by a table of weather forecasts for the locations. This is useful for anticipating hazardous road conditions such as ice and snow.

Weather data is obtained from the US National Weather Service API at weather.gov.
