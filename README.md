In this application, a user clicks on one or more locations on the map. Each click retrieves a seven-day weather forecast for that location. When the user clicks "Show Forecasts", the map disappears and is replaced by a table of the weather forecasts for all the selected locations. By clicking on several locations along the route of a planned trip, the user can find out the probable weather conditions for the trip.
