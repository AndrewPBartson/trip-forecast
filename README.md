This application provides seven-day weather forecasts for multiple locations. The locations are selected by clicking on the map. For example, the user may select locations along the route of a proposed trip. When the user clicks the "Show Forecasts" button, the map disappears and is replaced by a table of weather forecasts for the locations. This is especially useful for anticipating hazardous road conditions during the winter.
